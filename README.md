# Particle Swarm Optimization

The purpose of this project is to show the use of **PSO** (**P**article **S**warm **O**ptimization)
methods in minimizations problems. This particular example is focused on finding the minimal value
of a function. It is applied only for two dimmensional functions (which made possible to graphically 
represent algorithm's execution) but can be extended to any number of dimensions. Used functions:
- Sphere
- Griewangk 
- Rastrigin 
- Rosenbock 

For more details (formula/representation) on optimisation functions (including the used ones)
consult this [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization).

Another swarm intelligence based algorithm can be found here - 
[Ant Colony Optimization](https://github.com/Iulian-Stan/AntColonyOptimization).

## Solution

By running the application it can be seen that the system is initialized with a randomly placed 
**_particles_** - which represents the initial solution in the function's visible domain. It tries
to improve the solution gradually moving each particle closer to a possible solution. Eventually
all particles will gather in a single point representing the minimal value.
